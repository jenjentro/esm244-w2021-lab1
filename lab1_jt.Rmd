```

### Read in SF trees data

```{r}
sf_trees <- read_csv(here("data", "sf_trees", "sf_trees.csv"))
```
### Basic wrangling reminders

Refresh some skills for data wrangling and summary statistics using functions in the `dplyr` package. 

Find the top 5 highest observation of trees by legal_status. Do some wrangling, make a graph.

```{r}
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>%
  count(legal_status) %>%
  drop_na(legal_status) %>%
  rename(tree_count = n) %>% # New name goes on the left, old name goes on the right
  relocate(tree_count) %>% # Function for moving column around
  slice_max(tree_count, n = 5) # Tell function to look for top 5
```

Make a graph of those top 5 observations by legal status.

```{r}
ggplot(data = top_5_status,
       aes(x = legal_status, y = tree_count))
```
